Starting as a joke about how it would be to learn prime numbers in an app with a two button interface similar to Tinder, this idea turned into an actual prototype.

To work on older phones, I only used well supported web technologies. Of course, a proper build tool setup with transpiling, polyfills and vendor-prefixing is ideal for a serious project where you want to use new, improved web platform features. But skipping all distractions allowed me to focus on core features and create most of this prototype in an evening. Then I could get almost instant user feedback.

Even though I put some thought into the UX and designed the UI on paper before I wrote any code, this prototype has some issues that would be fixed in a full version. But after all, this was a really fun design project, thanks to the fast release and iteration. I'm especially happy with the UI design for the bottom section.
