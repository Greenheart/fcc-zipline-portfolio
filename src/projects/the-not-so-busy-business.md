A challenging text strategy game about a taxi/delivery-service. Including features like highscores, car-upgrades and character development. Really fun to create and loads of good practice to get fundamental programming concepts in place.

My biggest challenge with this project was to format the text-interface to fit the console. Especially the highscores were tricky. This was my last serious project built without a version control system as I realized it was hard to keep track of changes in a file 1000+ lines long. This project also taught me why modular code beat long functions that does multiple things... â˜º
