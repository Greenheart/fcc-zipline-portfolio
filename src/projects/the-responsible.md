At one point, I wanted to be an author. At another, I wanted to be a developer. So I figured, why not just do both?

This is an exploration of interactive storytelling. How to make characters and environments come alive, without using much more than a vivid language. Instead of fancy graphics, this game uses one of the best rendering engines available; the human imagination.

Since this game is built from the ground up, it's also a game engine. Several parts of this project could theoretically be reused for another text game with a completely different setting and story. This was not intentional during development, but rather a consequence of how the (at the time) most sane design choices ended up creating a modular project, where the content itself can be replaced.

Another fun part of this project is that ideas, planning and progress all were tracked in Git, making it easy to see design thoughts at a given time.
