In this minimalistic, turn based strategy game, your task is to seize control over the battlefield. It features gamemodes for PvP as well as experimental Player vs AI.

The technology behind this project makes heavy use of new features of the web platform. For example, I experimented with advanced CSS Transforms to achieve the isometric UI. I also used native CSS variables, something that greatly increases the usability of vanilla CSS. And of course, I used modern JavaScript.

Initially, this project was about creating a game with a nice UI and UX. But as things progressed, this turned out to be a great playing ground for learning about artificial intelligence.
