As the web platform matures and standardize over time, it's interesting to see what can be done without common libraries or frameworks. Even though modern tooling provides good structure and solutions for larger projects, they all rely on the fundamental web platform features.

Therefore, I like to keep up with the limits of the platform itself. It helps me better understand why the modern tools work the way they do, and what constraints they are built around.

Designed and implemented in a few days, this project was created so I could edit temporary notes in a focused environment, without leaving the browser. It's pretty convenient to just open a new tab and start typing in less than three seconds.
