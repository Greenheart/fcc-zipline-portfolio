A space-survival game created with Phaser as the game engine and Meteor for the real-time highscores. My main goal with this game was to spend a weekend to create a simple game with Phaser and then publish it to my friends. Since the development went so smooth, I decided to also implement the highscores to make the game more interesting.

This project taught me about publishing apps and gave me insights to some of the security issues that arises if you trust clients too much. Knowledge like this will be useful in the future!

A final warning: The simplistic gameplay proved to be quite addictive, so be careful if you try it... â˜º
