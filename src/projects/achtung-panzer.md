An intense 2D tank battle for two players on the same computer. Including two different ammo-types (long-range/low damage main cannon and short-range/high damage grenade launcher) which together with the randomly generated terrain, slowing world-objects like water and destroyable world-objects like stones results in a pretty neat little action-game where strategy and timing is crucial to crush your opponent.

This was a project I did together with some friends for a programming class in school. It was my first real project using Git and even though we used a Git-GUI, I learned pretty much about soure control.
